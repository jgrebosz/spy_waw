How to compile the spy program
============================================================

To be able to compile the spy program you must have installed
the ROOT program and the go4 program.

if you are not sure, just type go4. If the GO4 program does not start
- you must install it correctly
(How to do it: See the "Section B" below)


=========================================
Section A
How to compile and install the spy
=========================================

1. Download the last version of spy
It is available as *.tar file, or *.gz file
from the following directory

/misc/rising/jurek/sources/spy

2. Create on your computer the directory sources/spy
and unpack there - the spy sources.
If it is *tar file, you do it with a command

    tar -xvf  *.tar

If it is *.gz file, the command is similar  (one 'z' more)

    tar -zxvf *.tar

Now you are able to compile, but just to be sure, type:
go4
If the GO4 program will not start, you installed it wrongly (see section B)
If the Go4 program starts, just finish it and
now you are ready to compile the spy

3. Type

   make clean

4. Type

   make all

5. If your compilation is successful - the result will be the files:

spy
liAC4UserAnalisis.so
liAC4UserAnalisis.so.3.3.01  <-- where this numer is the number of Go4 version you have currently

6. You can start the spy just by typing

./spy

7. If it does not starts correcly, but you were able to start Go4 program, it means that
the operation system does not find the libraries:
  liAC4UserAnalisis.so
  liAC4UserAnalisis.so.3.3.01  
The secret is, that the libraries are searched in all directories which are listed
in the environment variable called LD_LIBRARY_PATH
You can check them just by typing
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH 

Actually this is not a problem yet, because you are going to run the spy in different directory:
just where your experiment data are placed.

So you have the choice
a) Put the files 
   spy
   liAC4UserAnalisis.so
   liAC4UserAnalisis.so.*
in the directory ~/bin
b) or put them in the directory where is your experiment data.
Anyway you need such a changes in your .bashrc file
 

export PATH=./:~/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./:~/bin:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

9. Now you can go to your directory with your experiment and
start the spy

   spy one_file_to_sort.lmd
or 
   spy "many_file_to_sort*.lmd"    <--- 'star' is possible, but note the " " in such a case

or
   spy  @list_of_files_to_sort.txt

NOTE: you can not run the spy just "anywhere". It must be the directory which has
all subdirectories needed (containing the lookup tables, calibrations, etc.)

=====================================
Section B
How to Install ROOT
=====================================

1. upack the sources to some directory (for example root_inst)
2. Make the another directory, where you are planing to have the result
(for example  root_dir)

3.
export ROOTSYS=path just created root_dir directory

4. go to the source directory root_inst

5.
./configure
make
make install

6. In your .bashrc file put

export ROOTSYS=/home/grebosz/root_inst  <-- put your version of the path here
export PATH=$ROOTSYS/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

7. execute this script
8. Type
root
just to be sure if all works OK.
You can leave root using the command:
.q

=====================================
Section C
How to Install GO4
=====================================

1. Download it from go4.gsi.de
2. unpack in some directory (the result will be also in the same directory)

3. go to this directory and type
. go4.login

4.
make clean
make all

5. After successful compilation edit the file go4login.sh
Just put the proper path to the go4 directory, root directory

6. In your .bashrc file (main directory) put a command which
executes the file go4login.sh
