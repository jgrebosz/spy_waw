The spectra of paritcular detectors are called

There are 8 strip detectors. Their symbols are A, B,C,D,E,F,G,H
Each of them has 32 strips. Their numbers are  00, 01, 02, ...., 29, 30, 31
Each strip gets 8 samples. Their aritmetic mean value is called energy raw.

 You can watch the spectra of these "energy raw" by selecting from the list.

strip_detectorA_plate_x_00_energy_raw.spc
strip_detectorG_plate_x_12_energy_raw.spc

By this you will see

1) the spectrum of the Strip detector A, channel (strip) nr 00
1) the spectrum of the Strip detector G, channel (strip) nr 12

You may calibrate these raw values. The calibration factors are placed in the
file called   calibration/strip_detector_calibration.txt
Its contents is for example:

//============  =====================================
//Energy calibration:     factor1*x + factor0

//                                                               factor0,              factor1  =====
//------------------- strip_detectorA ---------------------------

strip_detectorA_plate_x_00_energy_cal_factors      0           1
strip_detectorA_plate_x_01_energy_cal_factors      -10      0.9
... etc

The numbers  are so far fake.
Using these numbers, the partitular calibrated values will be calculated like this

strip_detectorA_plate_x_00_energy_cal = (strip_detectorA_plate_x_00_energy_raw * 1) + 0

strip_detectorA_plate_x_01_energy_cal = (strip_detectorA_plate_x_01_energy_raw * 0.9) - 10

--------------

 To see how good your stri detector is - you have also a statistics spectrum called "fan".
 It is panoramic view on the activity of all strips of one strip detector

 The spectrum is called for example

 strip_detectorA_plate_x_fan.spc

 If some strip delivers non-zero value - it is considered as "fired". In the particular channel of the fan spectrum
 the contents is incremented.
 If the strip nr 00 fires - the channel 0 is incremented
 If the strip nr 01 fires - the channel 10 is incremented
 If the strip nr 02 fires - the channel 20 is incremented
 If the strip nr 03 fires - the channel 30 is incremented
 ...
 If the strip nr 29 fires - the channel 290 is incremented
 If the strip nr 30 fires - the channel 300 is incremented
 If the strip nr 31 fires - the channel 310 is incremented

 As you can have some noise in your data, you may define a "threshold" value, actually even
 a "gate". Only the energies which will be above the threshold (inside the gate) are considered
 as sensible.

---------------
You can definie these thresholds (gates) in the file    options/strip_detector_settings.txt

  Here you see for example such a line

strip_detectorA_x_energy_gate    200      4096

This means, that we define the threshold for all the strips of the detector A, as 200 (till 4096).

Thresholds work on calibrated energy values. It is common to all the strips of one Strip Detector.
---------------

You can see another fan spectrum
 strip_detectorA_plate_x_fan_above_thresholds.spc

 where we include only strips which fired with "proper, sensible" energy.

----------------
If later on, you would like to calculate position where - on the whole strip detector - was the hit,
only these, 'sensible' energies are used for calculation.

-----------------

There is also a spectrum which tells the multiplicity of strips which fired. You have also the version
with the 'threshold condition'.

Hi Jurek!


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1) Data read via socket. It is already on the list of ToDos and we will
need it for the next test. The ideal situation would be to have the
possibility to choose between reading from socket (on-line analysis) or
from file, as it is now (off-line analysis). Nicola and I will provide
you a socket which you can read as soon as possible.

I almost finished this. Unfortunately now the socket gives me only header (40 bytes)
and zero bytes of useful data. So I could not test it precisely. Let me know, if there
will be a chance for a sensible data coming from the socket.


!!!!!!!!!!!!
2) Visualization of the amplitude of all the signals. I attach you a
picture to clarify what I mean. In practice I would like to see each and
all the 8 samples from each and all the 32 channels in one picture, per
event (so a plot of 256 channels in x-axis, the y-axis can be
normalized). This means that every X seconds you show the "real output"
of the ADC, so one can see it in "real time". Of course it makes sense
only when data is taken from socket.

It is not clear for me what you want.
Explain me:
a) what should be the name of the spectrum
b) what should be the range (from, to) and how
many channels.
(For example  From -200 to 4000, devided by 1000 channels (bins))

c) which signal will increment this spectrum. Is it a one signal
or many signals?
I mean: the incrementation happens every event; what from the event
should be used to increment this spectrum?

Is it one spectrum contributed by many signals, or many spectra?


3) Negative x-axis of the Spectrum. Now spectra go from 0 to 8191 but
sometimes I need to capsize a spectrum with respect to a certain value,
so I need the negative values (even temporarily). If I try to do it now
I don't see any resulting spectrum because probably the program discards
negative values.

There is a different approach.
But which spectrum - for example you need to watch in negative range?



4) If it is possible I would like to have only EXOTIC spectra in
./spectra/ directory. This way I will see only EXOTIC spectra in the
dialog window from where I load spectra. Does the spy program always
create all other spectra?

I removed many of them, but not all. The reason why they are still there
is that - forgive me saying so - our physicists seems to me not knowing
what the modern software can do for them.
I asked them to write to me something about their expermiment equipment,
but they never did.
So far - the program uses an "electronic engineer point of view".
We are just looking at signals. But finally it should be physics, which is seen
on the screen. They never told me what physics it will be.
This is why I keep all these spectra because I think, that most probably
they will need them, even if they do not know (and tell) this yet.



5) Custom names of Spectra. Is there a way to customize spectra file names?

There is a better tool: while you are working, you can create your own
spectrum and give it your favourite name, range, etc. I will show you this
by skype.




I hope I was clear, if you have doubt or comments please tell me.
I have put some huge data files in
pc647:/home/grebosz/pietro/exotic_data/ . They have been taken with a
striped silicon detector connected to channel 7 of ADC, so you see
useful spectra on "detector G" .spc files. You can use these files for
making tests.

Thanks,
ciao

pietro
